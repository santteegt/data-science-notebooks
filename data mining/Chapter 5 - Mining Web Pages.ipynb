      "The Louvre of the Industrial Age\n",
      "The Henry Ford is one of the world's great museums, and the world it chronicles is our own.\n",
      "by Tim O'Reilly | @timoreilly | +Tim O'Reilly | July 30, 2010\n",
      "This morning I had the chance to get a tour of The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI, along with Dale Dougherty, creator of Make: and Makerfaire, and Marc Greuther, the chief curator of the museum.  I had expected a museum dedicated to the auto industry, but it’s so much more than that.  As I wrote in my first stunned tweet, “it’s the Louvre of the Industrial Age.”\n",
      "When we first entered, Marc took us to what he said may be his favorite artifact in the museum, a block of concrete that contains Luther Burbank’s shovel, and Thomas Edison’s signature and footprints.  Luther Burbank was, of course, the great agricultural inventor who created such treasures as the nectarine and the Santa Rosa plum. Ford was a farm boy who became an industrialist; Thomas Edison was his friend and mentor. The museum, opened in 1929, was Ford’s personal homage to the transformation of the world that he was so much a part of.  This museum chronicles that transformation.\n",
      "The machines are astonishing – steam engines and coal-fired electric generators as big as houses, the first lathes capable of making other precision lathes (the makerbot of the 19th century), a ribbon glass machine that is one of five that in the 1970s made virtually all of the incandescent lightbulbs in the world, combine harvesters, railroad locomotives, cars, airplanes, even motels, gas stations, an early McDonalds’ restaurant and other epiphenomena of the automobile era.\n",
      "Under Marc’s eye, we also saw the transformation of the machines from purely functional objects to things of beauty.  We saw the advances in engineering — the materials, the workmanship, the design, over a hundred years of innovation.  Visiting The Henry Ford, as they call it, is a truly humbling experience.  I would never in a hundred years have thought of making a visit to Detroit just to visit this museum, but knowing what I know now, I will tell you confidently that it is as worth your while as a visit to Paris just to see the Louvre, to Rome for the Vatican Museum, to Florence for the Uffizi Gallery, to St. Petersburg for the Hermitage, or to Berlin for the Pergamon Museum.  This is truly one of the world’s great museums, and the world that it chronicles is our own.\n",
      "I am truly humbled that the Museum has partnered with us to hold Makerfaire Detroit on their grounds.  If you are anywhere in reach of Detroit this weekend, I heartily recommend that you plan to spend both days there.  You can easily spend a day at Makerfaire, and you could easily spend a day at The Henry Ford.\n",
      "P.S. Here are some of my photos from my visit .  (More to come soon. Can’t upload many as I’m currently on a plane.)\n",

His primary area of research is interactive computing with data and, specifically, Jupyter. He started the original IPython Notebook in 2011 and is one of the co-founders of Project Jupyter. He is also an active contributor to and co-leader of the JupyterLab project, which aims to take the Jupyter Notebook interface to the next level with its flexible building blocks for interactive and collaborative computing. We recently discussed JupyterLab, how feedback from notebook users informed its design, how its features could benefit the scientific and technical computing communities, and the role of notebooks in academia and even data journalism.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>What is JupyterLab and how does it represent what you've called the “evolution of the Jupyter web interface?”</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The classic Jupyter Notebook offers a number of different building blocks for interactive computing: the notebook, file browser, text editor, terminal, outputs, etc. We view JupyterLab as the evolution of the classic notebook, as it allows a more flexible and powerful way for working with those same building blocks. From a user’s perspective, we hope that everything in JupyterLab is familiar, but even more delightful and productive to work with.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Before going further, I want to acknowledge the incredible team working on Jupyter on many fronts, including software, design and organizational aspects. In particular, individuals on the <a href=\"http://jupyter.org/about.html\">Jupyter Steering Council</a> provide the foundation of the project and are all long-term contributors, without whom the project wouldn’t exist. The team building JupyterLab and PhosphorJS are the driving force behind the work I discuss here. Lastly, we are all grateful to Fernando Perez, creator of IPython and co-founder with us on Jupyter, for setting off into the uncharted wilderness of scientific open source software in 2001.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>What need is JupyterLab fulfilling among Jupyter Notebook users, particularly those who work in data science or scientific/technical computing?</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since the IPython Notebook came out in 2011, we have spent a lot of time talking to individual and organizational users to understand what delights them about the notebook, and what remains really painful. Some of those pain points are specific to the Jupyter Notebook and others are more general challenges they face working with code and data. Also, in 2015, we worked with IBM to run a user experience survey (the results of which are posted on <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/design/tree/master/surveys/2015-notebook-ux\">GitHub</a>). Based on all of this feedback, three key factors led us to develop JupyterLab.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>First, users love the notebook experience, and want it to improve, but without losing the core characteristics that make it the Jupyter notebook. This is important, because we could have re-thought the entire notebook abstraction itself in JupyterLab—but we didn’t. Thus, while we are making improvements to the notebook UI/UX in JupyterLab, notebooks are essentially the same (in fact, it is still 100% the same document format and server).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Second, users want to be able to combine, remix, and integrate the different building blocks to better support their workflows. A classic usage pattern we see is data scientists who begin working in an interactive Python shell, then migrate to a notebook, and eventually build and deploy a service based on that code. In the classic notebook, those transitions are really painful. In JupyterLab, we are trying to address the pain points of such an evolving workflow. For example, in JupyterLab we offer a document-less code console for quick exploration that supports Jupyter’s rich output, and which is integrated with the text file editor, so you can run blocks of code in a text file interactively, outside the notebook.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Third, collaboration is a significant area of need. As more and more groups and organizations adopt Jupyter, they need to work together with others on notebooks. Sure, notebooks can be shared on GitHub, Dropbox or email, but that is really painful and doesn’t represent how most of us work together. The next step beyond that is full real-time collaboration, in the style of Google Drive or Dropbox Paper. We have built JupyterLab with the abstractions needed to offer real-time collaboration on all documents (notebooks, text files, etc.). One of our postdocs at UC Berkeley has a prototype of real-time collaboration working in JupyterLab and our designers at Cal Poly are working on the UI/UX of this. We are having a lot of fun working on this right now, and are hopeful it is going to really help our users. It is worth mentioning that <a href=\"https://cocalc.com/\">CoCalc</a> (formerly SageMathCloud) now also offers a custom notebook front end for Jupyter that supports real-time collaboration.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>What has surprised you about the evolution of this project?</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We worked on designing the core abstractions of JupyterLab while iterating many times on the implementation. As we have converged on the current architecture and implementation, I have been surprised to see how the different abstractions can be combined to provide features we hadn’t initially envisioned. An example is the support we have for GeoJSON and CSV files. JupyterLab allows third-party extensions to declare handlers that enable users to edit or view different file types. We hadn’t appreciated how that would make it very easy for us and others to improve the user experience of working with common data formats. In JupyterLab, a user can double-click on a GeoJSON file and see a nicely rendered map based on <a href=\"http://leafletjs.com/\">Leaflet</a>, or a nice table view of a CSV file. Those views are integrated with our document models, so a user can edit the files in the text editor and immediately see updated versions of the rendered file. The same abstractions also gave us an integrated Markdown editor/renderer for free.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>There are a number of features planned for the summer release of JupyterLab 1.0, including theme switching, porting nbextensions, and hooking up kernels to output areas. How has the team prioritized features for beta and 1.0?</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Originally, the primary characteristic of JupyterLab 1.0 was going to be its feature parity with the classic Jupyter Notebook. That is evolving and we are starting to make deliberate choices to postpone work on more obscure features of the classic notebook, to make sure that the commonly used features in JupyterLab are well designed, both from the software/API perspective and the UI/UX design. From the UI/UX side, we are attempting to address a number of usability issues that have been with the classic notebook from the beginning, such as collapsable code cells and a better user experience for creating, running, deleting and moving cells. Users do those things hundreds or thousands of times and they are a bit too clunky. From the software/API perspective, we are working hard to offer clean public APIs that can used and extended by other developers. Those APIs are, in a sense, UI/UX for developers.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Beyond 1.0, what are some planned features of JupyterLab, and how have they been determined?</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A main priority after 1.0 is released is to help users and organizations make the transition from the classic notebook to JupyterLab. We realize the transition will take time and that we will need to provide a lot of support and documentation, etc. Beyond that, the real-time collaboration probably won’t be done for the 1.0 release, so that will be a significant area of focus beyond 1.0.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>How do notebooks feature in your academic work at Cal Poly?</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are two components of my academic work: teaching and research. On the teaching side I am currently teaching in Cal Poly’s undergraduate Data Science degree program (for Statistics and CS majors). I, and the other instructors in this program, use the notebook (through <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub\">JupyterHub</a>) for in-class lectures, homework, and projects. The same is true in the Computational Physics course in our department. These courses are really fun to teach and at this point, I can’t imagine teaching about code+data without the notebook.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On the research side, Jupyter is my primary area of research. In very broad terms, academia is struggling to understand how code and data, rather than traditional peer-reviewed papers, can be the primary output of academic research. At Cal Poly, the key phrase is “external validation,” which basically means, they want evidence that others find your research significant and impactful. Publications in traditional, peer-reviewed journals are one form of external validation. I assert that open source software, with significant user and developer communities, also has external validation. To their credit, Cal Poly and my department granted my tenure in 2014, largely based on my work in developing the Jupyter Notebook. Today, interactive computing with data remains my main area of research. This includes Jupyter and other open source projects such as <a href=\"https://github.com/altair-viz/altair\">Altair</a>.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One usage that I am particularly pleased with is Jupyter’s usage in the data journalism community. In the past few years, major news organizations have invested significantly in data journalism. Amongst others, this includes <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\">LA Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/\">Pro Publica</a>, and to many a surprise, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/news\">BuzzFeedNews</a>. Jeremy Singer-Vine and the team at BuzzFeedNews have led the way in setting a high bar for open and reproducible data journalism. In their <a href=\"https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews\">GitHub repository</a>, they provide the dataset and analysis (as a Jupyter Notebook) for all of the data-backed news articles published on BuzzFeedNews. Other news organizations are now following this practice as well. Given the highly politicized backlash against science and data-backed reality we are seeing in the U.S., I find this work extremely important and am proud that Jupyter has, in a small way, enabled it.</p>\n",

      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/1RBbqoc2jNQ/12-qualities-of-effective-design-organizations\n",
      "<p><img src=\"https://d3tdunqjn7n0wj.cloudfront.net/600x450/twelve-195676_1920_crop-a0bff06aaa2128f15880908adaf75134.jpg\" /></p><p><em>Learn what it takes to make the most of your design team.</em></p><section id=\"one2_qualities_of_effective_design_organ\"><p>In 2011, things began to turn around for NBA basketball team the Golden State Warriors. After years of apathetic leadership and poor performance, new owners made big moves, trading perceived franchise player Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut and hiring coach Mark Jackson. The next couple of years saw more talent acquisition, such that by 2013–2014, the team had its core roster: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Andrew Bogut. And even though they won 50 games for the first time in 20 years, they lost in the first round of the playoffs. Internal turmoil tore up the coaching staff, as Mark Jackson’s approach seemed to be one of “my way or the highway”—assistants who disagreed with him were let go, and players were pitted against each other. After the playoffs, Mark Jackson was fired, to be replaced by Steve Kerr, who installed a new coaching staff, and a much more inclusive and joyful management style that welcomed respectful disagreement in search of the best answer. Under such leadership, and with no significant roster changes, the Warriors dominated the league, winning 67 games and the NBA championship.</p>\n",
      "<p>There are two lessons for any team. The first is that skill and talent matter. By making big roster moves, the Warriors made back-to-back playoffs for the first time in over 20 years. But talent isn’t sufficient. The second lesson is that to get the most out of a team requires sensitive management, visionary leadership, and well-run operations. Design teams often suffer in this second area because, compared with other corporate functions like engineering and marketing, design is newer and its appreciation is less sophisticated. This nascency means that (a) most people in an organization have never worked with a truly effective <a id=\"iddle1243\"></a><a id=\"iddle1283\"></a><a id=\"iddle1440\"></a><a id=\"iddle1485\"></a>design team, and (b) most designers haven’t been part of fully actualized teams, and so they don’t know what they need in order to realize their own potential.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many design teams have the raw talent to realize the expanded role outlined in the prior chapter, but don’t yet have the maturity to embrace it. A design team’s output is the result not only of their skill, but the sophistication and sensitivity of how they operate. In this chapter, we present a set of qualities of effective design organizations. Assessing a team’s performance against each of these qualities clarifies opportunities for improvement.</p>\n",
      "<p>The qualities are broken up into three groups: Foundation, Output, and Management (<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom#one2_qualities_of_effective_desi-id00001\">Table 1-1</a>). The Foundation outlines the core concepts that drive the team’s behavior, and explain its very reason for being. With a strong Foundation established, energies then shift toward Output and Management. These qualities are indicative of the broader creative/operational split that is required to sustainably deliver good design, and is a theme throughout this book. Output and Management need to be tackled in tandem, as they reinforce each other. Output addresses what most people think of when considering design—is the team able to produce quality work across the necessary set of capabilities? Management addresses the unsung and often overlooked aspects of actually running a team. To realize team longevity and continued broadening impact, it’s imperative to treat operations as seriously as the work product.</p>\n",

Being intentional about the foundation leads to stronger work and more committed team members.</p>\n",
      "<section id=\"onedot_shared_sense_of_purpose\"><h4>1. Shared Sense of Purpose</h4>\n",
      "<p>Meaning and purpose are important for organizations at every level of scale. Companies have mission statements that orient and inspire their staff. Individuals have passions that motivate their behavior and decisions. Successful teams need a shared sense of purpose that establishes their identity and the impact they hope to have.</p>\n",
      "<p>Making this purpose explicit supports design teams by serving as:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li><p>A beacon that attracts talent excited by the purpose</p></li>\n",
      "<li><p>A rallying cry for team members as they do their work</p></li>\n",
      "<li><p>A signal to the rest of the organization of what to expect from the team</p></li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>One way to articulate this shared sense of purpose is through a team charter. Charters can come in all shapes and sizes, from brief mission statements to lengthier documents that detail how a team operates. Start brief and expand as needed. Every design team is different, so no one charter will apply universally. We propose the following as a way to get started.</p>\n",
      "<blockquote><p>We’re not here just to make it pretty or easy to use. Through empathy, we ensure meaning and utility. With craft, we elicit understanding and desire. We wrangle the complexity of our offering to deliver a clear, coherent, and satisfying experience from start to finish.</p></blockquote></section><section id=\"twodot_focusedcomma_empowered_leadership\"><h4>2. Focused, Empowered Leadership</h4>\n",
      "<p>Successful teams, including design teams, have strong, formal leadership. Leaders have an intimate understanding of how the team should work, make decisions that benefit the team, and have the respect of the <a id=\"iddle1282\"></a>team’s members. They then take this internal team understanding and translate it to the rest of the organization, ensuring the team is set up to succeed within the larger whole.</p>\n",
      "<p>Because of design’s nascency as a corporate function, design leadership often receives short shrift. With small design teams, it is common for a squad of junior-to-senior designers to report to someone who is not a designer, but instead in product management, engineering, or marketing. To a certain extent, this is acceptable—small teams are often at the start of their journey, and are part of a company that is in a more fluid state. Hopefully, the company just hasn’t had the wherewithal to yet bring on a strong design leader, but knows that it ought to.</p>\n",
      "<p>More frustrating are large organizations that should know better but continue this practice. An example was a Silicon Valley company (that shall remain nameless) that had four design directors as peers, each reporting to the VP of Product Management. While it might seem that design had real presence, in actuality none of the design directors were the head of design—that VP was. And that person was making decisions that affected the design team, even though he didn’t understand the potential that design could be delivering.</p>\n",
      "<p>A design team needs to be in charge of its own destiny, and this requires <em>focused leadership</em> with <em>autonomy</em> and <em>executive access</em>.</p>\n",
      "<section id=\"focused_leadership\"><h5>Focused leadership</h5>\n",
      "<p>We’re using the phrase “focused leadership” to mean one or two people are running design and are from within the design organization—these leaders are not also overseeing other functions.</p>\n",
      "<p>While design leaders must be attentive to issues of quality, a common mistake made by many companies is that they place in this role a design visionary, a creative director with big ideas and an obsessive attention to detail. A design organization is an entity that needs care, nurturing, diplomacy, and leadership. The skills that made someone a great designer or creative director are almost wholly unrelated to the skills that make them a great manager and team leader. Instead, this design leader’s primary responsibilities will prove organizational, working with other executives to clear the path for design, and serving as a manager, mentor, team builder, and operator for the team itself, creating both a figurative and literal space where design can thrive.</p>\n",
      "<p><a id=\"iddle1037\"></a><a id=\"iddle1267\"></a>For most organizations, a single leader suffices. In fact, this quality was originally labeled “singular, empowered leadership,” because it’s important that there is a clear line of authority within the design organization (and not a set of supposed leaders, all as peers, reporting into a non-design role). However, as the team grows, it might become necessary to split leadership into two—one person focused on creative matters, and the other on operational. There are many examples of such a split in other fields. Technology organizations have a CTO who serves more as a software architect, and a VP of Engineering who makes sure the team is running effectively. Publications have Editors-in-Chief and Managing Editors. In filmmaking, there is the Director and the Producer. And some design teams now have a lead Creative Director and a VP of Design (these roles are explained in detail in <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/org-design-for/9781491938393/ch05.html?utm_source=oreilly&amp;utm_medium=newsite&amp;utm_campaign=12-qualities-of-effective-design-organizations\">Chapter 5</a>). This partnership model allows the creative leader to focus and more deeply engage on the entire journey and key initiatives while allowing the operational leader to focus on portfolio planning, capacity and hiring, budgeting, and an operating plan.</p></section><section id=\"autonomy\"><h5>Autonomy</h5>\n",
      "<p>With focused leadership established, they must have autonomy over how the design organization works. Leadership’s overarching responsibility is to make their organization as effective and efficient as possible, and given the expanded role of design, this will likely mean it doesn’t conform to how other departments are structured or operate. This requires freedom to establish methods of practice, both internal to the design team and cross-functionally. And, finally, because design teams are always asked to do more than they have the capacity for, leadership must be able to prioritize their own efforts. For design to be seen as a truly essential contributor, it must be able to focus efforts on what matters, and say “No” to that which is not crucial.</p></section><section id=\"executive_access\"><h5>Executive access</h5>\n",
      "<p>For design to realize its full potential, leadership must be only one or two rungs away from the CEO, and so must either be an executive or have executive access. If too far away from the “C-suite,” then the politics needed to navigate the organizational reality of end-to-end experiences becomes extremely difficult. Such distance makes it easy for others to dismiss design’s contribution. Executive engagement (whether in the form of sponsorship, organizational cover, or simple reporting <a id=\"iddle1014\"></a><a id=\"iddle1028\"></a><a id=\"iddle1213\"></a><a id=\"iddle1244\"></a><a id=\"iddle1284\"></a><a id=\"iddle1287\"></a><a id=\"iddle1550\"></a><a id=\"iddle1563\"></a><a id=\"iddle1586\"></a><a id=\"iddle1589\"></a>structures) demonstrates the importance that design has within the organization. Such executive support will prove necessary as the expanded role of design inevitably upsets corporate “business as usual.”</p></section></section><section id=\"threedot_authentic_user_empathy\"><h4>3. Authentic User Empathy</h4>\n",
      "<p>Essential in design’s ability to succeed is an authentic understanding of user contexts and behaviors. This goes beyond standard practices of market research and user testing, and toward deeper engagement with the lives of the people being served. Nothing beats going into people’s homes or offices, and following them as they go about their days. While quantitative and marketing methods such as usage analytics and surveys provide data as to where things aren’t working, findings from such efforts focus on optimizations and point solutions. Good user research, particularly out in the field, reveals a richness of understanding that you simply cannot get anywhere else. It is this work that ends up revealing a customer’s journey, and inevitably, the experiential breakdowns that happen when people try to accomplish things that require them to unknowingly cross siloed departments in an organization.</p>\n",
      "<p>The primary benefit of such observations is that designers develop empathy for their users, which in turns leads them to design systems that have real impact, and avoid solutions that will be rejected by the intended audience. A secondary benefit that can be just as important is when executives and other people with authority outside of design witness the results of such user research, whether it’s the raw data (e.g., videos of people expressing frustration with the current situation), or the analyses that makes clear problematic patterns. When these executives ask how these breakdowns can be addressed, this is the opportunity to step up and show how design, specifically service design, can propose solutions that integrate silos.</p></section><section id=\"fourdot_understandcomma_articulatecomma\"><h4>4. Understand, Articulate, and Create Value</h4>\n",
      "<p>After the dot-com bust in 2001 and the recession that followed, a cry heard throughout the software design community was “How do I demonstrate return on investment (ROI)?” At that time, most companies saw design as a cost of doing business, and something to minimize when times were tight. At Adaptive Path, we pursued this question <a id=\"iddle1051\"></a><a id=\"iddle1163\"></a><a id=\"iddle1430\"></a><a id=\"iddle1710\"></a>through research that led to a 2003 report, “Leveraging Business Value: How ROI Changes User Experience.”<sup><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom#ch03fn01\" id=\"ch03fn01-marker\">1</a></sup> While unable to identify a simple equation of <em>x</em> design leading to <em>y</em> value, the report stated:</p>\n",
      "<blockquote><p>Our research revealed that using ROI and other valuation methods helps to evolve design competency within organizations. The valuation methods provide tools for developing and measuring a design strategy as a component of a larger business strategy: The ability to “value” user experience design makes it a visible and credible business lever on par with marketing, research and development, and channel strategy. As a result, applying ROI-measuring techniques to user experience investment decisions has a positive impact on how [design] teams are structured and perceived within an organization.</p></blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Given design’s success in the decade-plus since that report, it might seem that the value of design is understood and such practices are no longer warranted. However, for a design organization to realize its full potential, its members must still be able to speak the language of value in a meaningful way. If designers shield themselves in the cloak of “creatives” as a way not to engage with the business, they will lose impact and credibility. Designers need to understand how their work contributes to business success.</p>\n",
      "<p>Too often, designers practice design-for-design’s-sake, where what’s produced, however cool or innovative, isn’t connected with the company’s goals. Savvy design leaders embrace business value, realizing it can serve as a powerful input into the design process. Whether it’s “hard” metrics such as improving conversion rates or increasing engagement times, or “soft” matters such as representing the company’s brand in an elegant and appropriate way, these connections to what the company cares about are crucial for keeping design efforts on track. And when these business objectives are paired with authentic user empathy, new means of value creation can emerge. When design organizations propose ways to unlock new business value, their credibility and impact increases.</p></section></section><section id=\"output\"><h3>Output</h3>\n",

      "<section id=\"fivedot_support_the_entire_journey\"><h4>5. Support the Entire Journey</h4>\n",
      "<p>“Support the entire journey” has a few implications. One is that the design team must have access to, and be involved with, all aspects of the customers’ journeys. This will likely require change in how the rest of the organization thinks about design, because it means the design team engages areas where it had not been considered relevant, such as the high-touch practices of sales and customer service.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another implication is that there should be only one design organization to undergird the entire customer journey. This runs contrary to a common practice, where companies often have two teams—a product or UX design team and a marketing design team. This is the legacy of 20th-century mass manufacturing thinking, where the way a product is designed and developed is divorced from how the product is sold and talked about. In a services world, this distinction no longer holds. “Marketing” and “product” experiences are simply milestones on the same customer journey. Also, whereas traditional marketing design was delivered through media (publications, broadcast, billboards) and product design was for a thing placed on a retail shelf, in a world of connected software, the platform for many marketing and product experiences has converged in digital realms such as email, web, and mobile. Granted, there are efforts particular to specific media—users don’t interact with products on a billboard—but those are relatively few, and diminishing. Companies beholden to the archaic “marketing” and “product” distinctions also get in the way of new opportunities, such as the rise of “growth” product development, where what would have been considered a classic marketing function (acquiring users) becomes part of product development.</p>\n",
      "<p>Given a single design organization invited to work end to end throughout the customer’s journey, a third implication arises: the need for a vast array of design skills to address the totality of that journey (<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom#design_skills_needed_for_an_end-to-end_s\">Table 1-2</a>).</p>\n",

      "<p>A final implication arises in recognition of how overwhelming such a broad mandate can be. In a connected-software-and-services world, to render an entire journey is a matter of managing overwhelming complexity. There are too many moving parts, too much specialized knowledge necessary to fully appreciate a situation. Designers can no longer rely solely on the hard skills of their practice and craft to succeed. They need to facilitate the creative output of others throughout the organization, tapping into a resource often left dormant. If working in a hospital setting, get nurses, technicians, and doctors to ideate around their specific problems. In a call center, have the customer service representatives pitch how they think things should be. The point isn’t to be bound to the input from other functions—the design organization still has the crucial responsibility of refining, honing, and executing these ideas. But realize that the problems we’re solving are too big for any one team to have a complete handle on.</p></section></section><section id=\"sixdot_deliver_at_all_levels_of_scale\"><h4>6.

      "<p>A design organization ought to be able to operate across these levels of scale regardless of its size. If the organization is just establishing an internal design function, the implication is that hiring a single <a id=\"iddle1200\"></a><a id=\"iddle1488\"></a><a id=\"iddle1553\"></a><a id=\"iddle1638\"></a>designer is insufficient, because there’s no way you’ll find someone who can span all these levels competently. Instead, bring on two designers as quickly as you can, one who can take the bulk of the lower level work (spending 80% of their time in Surface and 20% in Structure), and another who can do some of that, but also engage strategically and across the organization (spending 60% of their time in Structure, 30% of their time in Strategy, and 10% addressing The Big Picture).</p>\n",
      "<p>Newly hired design leaders brought in to run an existing organization can use this model to plan their next set of hires. When Peter was hired to run design at one company, he inherited an organization whose efforts mostly consisted of turning product managers’ requirements into comps, and where user research made an impact only at the interface level. This immaturity was not imposed by the rest of the organization—product managers and engineers were eager for greater design contributions. Assessing the team’s capability, he found that it was strong in delivering at the Surface level, mediocre when it came to Structure, and pretty much non-existent with matters of Strategy. Thus, design was getting in its own way when trying to have more of an impact. This drove Peter’s decision to recruit designers who could deliver quality work at the Structure and Strategy levels. As they came onboard, design’s influence grew organically.</p></section><section id=\"sevendot_establish_and_uphold_standards\"><h4>7. Establish and Uphold Standards of Quality</h4>\n",
      "<p>A design organization is ultimately judged by the quality of its output. What’s tricky is that there’s no universal definition of design quality. So while “high-quality engineering” is typically considered through quantifiable metrics such as reduction of bugs shipped, speed of performance, and service uptime, “high-quality design” is understood through subjective measures rooted in personal preference and taste. Sure, design solutions can have quantitative performance measures such as conversion rates and task completion, but they are insufficient in establishing quality. The ultimate assessment of quality often exists in the eyes of the beholders.</p>\n",
      "<p>To overcome this, the design organization must be empowered to define quality standards for their team and their organization. Those standards then must be externalized so that others know what is being upheld. The goal is to take as much subjectivity as possible out of the equation, shifting design critique from a stance of personal preferences (“I really love this shade of blue”) or a desire to stand out (the infamous “make the logo bigger”) to an agreed-upon set of principles and guidelines that explain the team’s definition of quality, supported by numerous examples of design work that demonstrate good quality with callouts as to why.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once the design org has established such quality standards, they must hold themselves up to those standards, and not sacrifice. The rest of the organization will likely act in a way that unintentionally discourages quality. People outside of the design team don’t understand what it takes to maintain a high quality bar, and design teams are asked to do too many things with too few people in too little time.</p>\n",
      "<p>Too often, these teams try to do it all. Designers exhibit a couple of traits that can get them into trouble. One is a desire to please. Designers want to make others (clients, colleagues, users) happy. And so, when asked to do a thing, the default is often “Yes.” The other is a revulsion at seeing work go out without designer involvement. Even when not asked to contribute, if they see that something might be shipped that wasn’t intentionally designed, they’ll try to find a way to take part, so that what is released isn’t terrible.</p>\n",
      "<p>These intentions are good, but the results are self-defeating. Teams get spread too thin, supporting too many programs, working overlong hours, and ultimately delivering subpar work. A design organization is only as good as what it delivers, and if it is producing crap because it’s trying to do too many things, then the rest of the organization will associate design with crap. Design leaders need to wield the power of “No.” Design work should only be done when adequately prioritized and staffed, and when there is time to develop quality solutions. This should not mean excessively long schedules for rumination and exploration. Good leaders know that there are points where design practice realizes diminishing returns, where further effort no longer leads to improved results. What it does mean is empowering the design organization to uphold what it takes to deliver quality, and to decline work that doesn’t fit.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many design organizations rely on process as a proxy for quality. This is a false connection. Critical thinking is essential for delivering great work, and an over-adherence to a methodology leads to teams making unthinking decisions. While a high-level process or general approach can help designers communicate how they work with other functions, insisting on a granular step-by-step process for every project engenders <a id=\"iddle1144\"></a><a id=\"iddle1215\"></a><a id=\"iddle1331\"></a><a id=\"iddle1361\"></a><a id=\"iddle1491\"></a><a id=\"iddle1564\"></a>a rigidity that can actually harm quality. Design problems vary, and design teams should be familiar with a range of approaches and methods to solve them appropriately. “We must follow a user-centered design process” may sound like a good plan, but when any process becomes an assumption or accepted dogma, it becomes a crutch that replaces critical thinking. Instead of following a well-trod process, design leadership should make the effort to figure out the best ways to tackle different challenges, drawing from a broad methodological toolkit.</p></section><section id=\"eightdot_value_delivery_over_perfection\"><h4>8. Value Delivery Over Perfection</h4>\n",
      "<p>In a world where speed is often vaunted above all else, this talk of upholding quality makes some people nervous. So, “delivery over perfection” is meant to balance “establish and uphold quality.” There’s a quote attributed to Steve Jobs during the development of Macintosh: “Real artists ship.” This recognizes that even the most masterful craftspeople, if they are actually hoping to have some kind of impact, must stop what they’re doing and get their work out into the world.</p>\n",
      "<p>Designers can have trouble realizing that delivery is just part of an ongoing process. For those who went to design school, every time they made something, they had one chance to get it right. And even digital design practices have their roots in traditional media, where once something is produced, it’s in the world and out of your hands. This background encourages perfectionism, with a concomitant unwillingness to ship until you get it just right. With connected software and services, delivery should be frequent. By making delivery a habit (and not a rare event), the idea of The Launch loses its paralyzing power.</p>\n",
      "<p>That said, continuous delivery should not be an excuse to ship bad stuff, with the notion of fixing it later. This is another place where leadership comes into play, because striking the right balance between quality and delivery is a matter of judgment. At IBM, they teach designers how to recognize when something is “ready,” because with software, you’re never really done.<sup><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom#ch03fn03\" id=\"ch03fn03-marker\">3</a></sup> That recognition of ready should discourage designers from noodling in the pursuit of an elusive ideal. Labeling something <a id=\"iddle1441\"></a><a id=\"iddle1445\"></a><a id=\"iddle1549\"></a><a id=\"iddle1561\"></a>as “ready” may upset a team who doesn’t believe the design is good enough yet, but ultimately the best way to gauge quality is not some internal assessment, but use by real people.</p></section></section><section id=\"management\"><h3>Management</h3>\n",
      "<p>A seriously underappreciated aspect of the long-term health of a design team is its management. Design leaders are rarely trained as managers, and lack familiarity, and sometimes interest, in the nuts and bolts of running their team.

      "<p>The department name “Human Resources” demonstrates how many companies think of their employees—not as people, but as economic units whose role is to contribute to a company’s productivity. Design leadership must make the effort, which can run contrary to the broader organization’s approach, to engage the team members as people. In return, those team members will be committed and engaged in the work for the long haul.</p>\n",

      "<p>A byproduct of bureaucratic work environments is that they encourage treating employees as cogs in a machine, not as the idiosyncratic people that they really are. Job titles imply equivalence and interchangeability for anyone with the same title. Discrete numbered levels are used to assess seniority and salary ranges. Org charts delimit access and authority.</p>\n",
      "<p>Actualized design teams overcome such practices by treating team members as individuals, with all the messiness implied. They recognize job titles are imperfect, and two people with the same title may have different skills. That’s OK, though, because everyone knows those people’s strengths and weaknesses, and makes sure that they’re set up <a id=\"iddle1216\"></a><a id=\"iddle1245\"></a><a id=\"iddle1672\"></a>to succeed. Seniority levels are seen as guidelines, not strict containers. Reporting structures are there for communication and mentorship, and do not limit anyone’s ability to share ideas and have an impact.</p>\n",
      "<p>While maintaining this individualistic perspective is challenging as the design organization grows, it’s worth the effort.

Overly long work weeks deliver a double whammy to designers—along with the obvious struggle with work/life balance, designers, as creative professionals, need to disconnect in order to recharge. Constant production and overlong hours stagnates work quality, as designers rely on what is basic and safe.

When Peter joined one company, he inherited a product design team of 11 men and 2 women, almost all in their mid-20s. Peter witnessed how this narrowed the team’s worldview, with expectations that users had a degree of savvy with mobile and web conventions as they who were born digital. However, the company’s audience was overwhelmingly female and middle-aged. And while a design team shouldn’t necessarily reflect its user base, and user research can go far in engendering empathy for those different from ourselves, by having a variety of perspectives and backgrounds represented, designers are encouraged at all times to check their assumptions.</p>\n",

Race and ethnic diversity have long been challenges for the design industry, and very little has changed in the 20 years the authors have worked in the field. It’s not an easy problem to solve, because even those eager to hire for diversity are hindered by the lack of diverse candidates. And diverse candidates might find themselves subject to unintentionally biased recruiting, interviewing, and promotion practices.</p>\n",
      "<p>Making change will take time. Work with grade schools as well as universities, introducing design as an exciting, important, and inclusive field of practice to communities who might simply be unaware of it. Connect with organizations such as the Inneract Project (<a href=\"http://www.inneractproject.org\"><em class=\"hyperlink\">http://www.inneractproject.org</em></a>) and the Level Playing Field Institute (<a href=\"http://www.lpfi.org\"><em class=\"hyperlink\">http://www.lpfi.org</em></a>) to support their missions of increasing opportunities for underserved students.

Foster a Collaborative Environment</h4>\n",
      "<p>Realizing the benefit of diverse perspectives requires a supportive environment where people are encouraged and comfortable sharing their work, spurring collaboration that makes the final output better than what anyone would deliver on their own.</p>\n",
      "<p>Every member of the team must demonstrate respect to every other member, or the openness required for successful collaboration will not emerge. Dismissiveness, insults, cattiness, and behind-the-back gossip lead to people feeling shamed and shut down, and cannot be tolerated. Instead, train the team to give authentic feedback and to deal with disagreements constructively.</p>\n",
      "<p>Earning one another’s respect is necessary in order for the team to “get real,” because frank and candid critique and feedback are essential for upholding the quality standards. Greatness comes from the tension and collision of different perspectives (a concept known as “creative abrasion”), addressed openly and honestly. Design teams that favor politeness over candor will rarely produce great work.</p>\n",
      "<p>Organizational hierarchy can stifle the free flow of ideas within a design organization—when senior people speak, it often stops the conversation. It’s now become cliche, but it’s worth repeating—great ideas <a id=\"iddle1207\"></a><a id=\"iddle1444\"></a><a id=\"iddle1481\"></a><a id=\"iddle1557\"></a>can come from anywhere. Great design leaders encourage everyone to speak up, and, for themselves, wait to speak last, if at all. These leaders must also place their work alongside others, and accept others’ critique with grace and humility.</p>\n",
      "<p>The collaborative environment referred to so far has been figurative, but it also should be made literal. Great design work takes space—places to collaborate, whiteboards for sketching and ideation, walls to show work. And those spaces should be permanent, places where the team works and sees their work all around them. Not only does this encourage continual engagement from the team itself, such spaces enable people outside the team to quickly connect with the work. It literally demonstrates openness and transparency. And instead of having occasional big share-outs (that require preparation that takes time away from productivity), these spaces support frequent lightweight check-ins. This keeps the work on track, because if it begins to veer off-course, it is quickly corrected.</p>\n",
      "<p>If physical spaces are infeasible (e.g., offices are simply too small, people work in a remote or distributed fashion), make the extra effort to create such environments virtually. Thanks to a whole host of tools such as Basecamp, Slack, Trello, Mural, and others, it’s easier than ever for designers to collaborate online. Such solutions can never fully replace a well-stocked project room, and they require a little extra effort to make them useful, but with a little discipline they can prove quite satisfactory.</p>\n",
      "<p>(In <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/org-design-for/9781491938393/ch08.html?utm_source=oreilly&amp;utm_medium=newsite&amp;utm_campaign=12-qualities-of-effective-design-organizations\">Chapter 8</a>, we delve further into how to create environments that bring the most out of the people in them.)</p></section><section id=\"one2dot_manage_operations_effectively\"><h4>12. Manage Operations Effectively</h4>\n",
      "<p>The most underappreciated aspect of running a design organization is the importance of smooth operations (cue Sade). Just because design is “creative,” it shouldn’t get a pass in terms of running effectively. Much of what causes designers to stress in their work is the result of flawed operations. Symptoms include:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li><p>Trouble coordinating internally, particularly around process, communications, and file management</p></li>\n",
      "<li><p>Difficulty collaborating with other parts of the organization</p></li>\n",

      "<li><p>Non-existent measurement</p></li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>Such symptoms make people feel like they are spinning their wheels, expending a lot of effort with little to show for it. Ironically, though, designers often resist practices and policies meant to streamline their work, concerned with how it may inhibit creativity. In other cases, too much process will mask deficiencies in other areas, such as lack of a clear strategy, vision, or roadmap, and doing the work feels too prescriptive and constrained. Accelerated hiring and inadequate—or non-existent—onboarding further exacerbate problems (there’s a section on onboarding in <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/org-design-for/9781491938393/ch08.html?utm_source=oreilly&amp;utm_medium=newsite&amp;utm_campaign=12-qualities-of-effective-design-organizations\">Chapter 8</a>).</p>\n",
      "<p>If done well, team members will learn to appreciate the ability to remain focused on the work, instead of being sucked into the work-about-the-work that insidiously steals a surprising amount of time.</p></section></section><section id=\"our_humanistic_agenda\"><h3>Our Humanistic Agenda</h3>\n",
      "<p>Twentieth-century management practices were dominated by Scientific Management, which sought to squeeze the most productivity out of a workforce, and bureaucracy, which treated employees as interchangeable widgets. This mechanistic view of labor, where teams and individuals were considered solely on their output, worked in an economy dominated by the mass manufacturing of products. However, companies have brought it forward to the 21st-century challenge of connected software and services, and it proves tone deaf. Services hinge on relationships, and relationships occur between people. If a company has poor relationships with its own employees, how can it expect to have good ones with its customers? This humanistic orientation is even more important for the design team, as the very nature of their work exploits their humanity, from the empathy they draw from customer research to their design solutions expressing their perspectives.</p>\n",
      "<p>Use these 12 qualities as guidelines for assessing a design organization. Have all the team members score the organization against each quality, and use the results to identify areas that need work. By making it an inclusive, whole-team activity, you ensure that responsibility for improvement is shared by everyone, further strengthening the team’s bond.</p></section><div id=\"id-MrUaUE\">\n",

      "<p><strong>For those less familiar with emotion AI, can you describe what the field encompasses?</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Emotion AI is the idea that devices should sense and adapt to emotions like humans do. This can be done in a variety of ways—understanding changes in facial expressions, gestures, physiology, and speech. Our relationship with technology is changing, as it’s becoming a lot more conversational and relational. If we are trying to build technology to communicate with people, that technology should have emotional intelligence (EQ). This manifests in a broad range of applications: from Siri on your phone to social robots, even applications in your car.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>How is emotion AI related to sentiment analysis for natural language processing? </strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Social scientists who have studied how people portray emotions in conversation found that only 7-10% of the emotional meaning of a message is conveyed through the words. We can mine Twitter, for example, on text sentiment, but that only gets us so far. About 35-40% is conveyed in tone of voice—how you say something—and the remaining 50-60% is read through facial expressions and gestures you make. Technology that reads your emotional state, for example by combining facial and voice expressions, represents the emotion AI space. They are the subconscious, natural way we communicate emotion, which is nonverbal and which complements our language. What we say is also very cognitive—we have to think about what we are going to say. Facial expressions and speech actually deal more with the subconscious, and are more unbiased and unfiltered expressions of emotion.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>What techniques and training data do machines use to perceive emotion?</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>At Affectiva, we use a variety of computer vision and machine learning approaches, including deep learning. Our technology, like many computer vision approaches, relies on machine learning techniques in which algorithms learn from examples (training data). Rather than encoding specific rules that depict when a person is making a specific expression, we instead focus our attention on building intelligent algorithms that can be trained to recognize expressions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Through our partnerships across the globe, we have amassed an enormous emotional database from people driving cars, watching media content, etc. A portion of the data is then passed on to our labeling team, who are certified in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System\">Facial Action Coding System (FACS)</a>. Their day-to-day job is to take video from a repository and label it as training data for the algorithms. We are continuously investing in approaches such as active learning (human-assisted machine learning) and transfer learning (the idea that a model-specific modality or data set can then transfer to a different data set, so a video analyzed for facial expression can also be labeled for the speech modality).</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Where is emotion AI currently seeing the most market traction?</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We got our start in ad content testing applications. We work with a third of the Fortune 500 companies, helping them to understand consumers’ emotional responses to their ads. The problem we were able to solve was to assist them in developing deep emotional content with their customers, then help them understand if that content was successful or not. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html?_r=0\">recent Pepsi ad</a> is a great example of how emotion AI may be used—they created this ad, and it caused a huge backlash. Think of how much incentive there was to find this out earlier in order to intervene; they could have pulled the campaign, edited, and re-shot before the PR disaster. Our technology provides a moment-by-moment readout of the viewers’ emotional journey to online ads, a tv show, or a movie trailer. We recently released the capability to test a full-length movie.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>More recently, we have seen the most traction around conversational interfaces. There are the obvious devices—Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home—but we’ve also seen an increasing need for emotion AI manifesting in automotive, social robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The idea is to better connect with these devices so they can more efficiently do things for you. We are in the proof-of-concept phase for many of these markets and are actively figuring out platform integrations.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>As Affectiva has grown from a research project at MIT to a company, what has been most surprising to you? </strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we first started as company, I underestimated the value of the data we collected—it has a number of dimensions. Affectiva’s emotion database has grown to nearly six million faces analyzed in 75 countries. To be precise, we have gathered 5,313,751 face videos, for a total of 38,944 hours of data, representing nearly two billion facial frames analyzed. Our data is also global, spanning ages and ethnicities, in a variety of contexts (from people sitting on their couches to driving a car).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The wealth of data we collected also allowed us to mine our robust data set for cross-cultural and gender differences in expressing emotions. We recently released findings from <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170419006387/en/Affectiva-Releases-Findings-Largest-Cross-Cultural-Study-Gender\">the largest cross-cultural study on gender differences in facial expressions</a>, which used our technology. In this paper, for example, we found that women smile more and longer than men, while men show expressions that are indicative of anger more frequently and longer than women.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Lastly, this data gives us unique business insights around how emotions in ads vary across the world and by product category. For example, we've seen that pet care and baby ads in the U.S. elicit more enjoyment than cereal ads—which see the most enjoyment in Canada.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Your Ph.D. is in computer science. Are there any specialized skills you needed to learn to enable computers to recognize human expressions?</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Experience in machine learning was key, as was computer vision, pattern recognition, and just being really curious. I had no degree in psychology, but had to brush up on the basics of psych, the science of emotion, and neuroscience to really understand how humans and the human brain process emotion. We borrow a lot of that science and embed it into our technology.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Tell us about the use case for emotion AI that has been personally most compelling or fun for you to see.</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Personally, the most compelling use case for me tackles mental health applications: the capabilities here are quite powerful. Early on, we partnered with a company called<a href=\"http://www.affectiva.com/success-story/brain-power/\"> Brain Power</a> to bring use cases to market. They use our technology and Google Glass to help autistic children with emotion recognition and understanding, an area of identified need in many children and adults with autism. Outside of that use case, I am particularly interested in applications that monitor mental health for emotional well-being and suicide prevention. In our current world of the quantified self—featuring fitness data from wearables and fitness apps—what if your emotional health played a role as well? We are exploring product concepts that will be able to do just that, so users can better monitor their emotional health and well-being around the clock, and can flag when they are having a bad day.</p>\n",

      "<p>Right now, Docker is an excellent tool to manage distributed applications. This is the result of quite a bit of evolution; in its earlier stages, Docker focused mainly on managing containers themselves. Thinking back to two or three years ago, getting started with Docker was a bit of a pain because there weren’t very mature developer tools in the ecosystem. Instead you were left with documentation and really long “docker run” commands, and you really had to know what was happening at the container level. Now Docker has grown and evolved a bit to where the container is just an implementation detail, allowing you as an engineer to focus on what’s really important: the services themselves. Orchestration tools like Docker (in Swarm Mode), Kubernetes, and Mesosphere allow you to declare your services once and then run them anywhere using containers. The focus now is more on running highly-available applications and less on the inner workings of the container itself, so you interact with Docker on a different level.</p><p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/using-docker-in-production\">Using Docker in production.</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/2PHmDJJ4QUI\" width=\"1\" />\n",

Here’s the short summary: the data shows that there is actually very little variation in demand volatility for cloud datacenters at the moment, thus the current pricing model makes sense. If you look more closely at actual CPU utilization rates, though, you see that behind the constantly powered-on VMs, there are true variations in usage patterns. Therefore, as we move to cloud-native applications, and especially to models such as serverless that can much more effortlessly and granularly scale up and down in response to changing demands, we can expect the optimum pricing models to also change. Even then, it appears that having just two price bands, peak and off-peak—with off-peak times set in advance, would obtain the majority of the efficiency gains available.</i>\n",

However, you have to ask yourself if you have the team resources to accomplish the chore, or if you would rather have your team work to keep your core product fast and functional.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Luckily, there is another option, one that leverages embedded analytics. With that in mind, let’s take a deeper dive into the world of embedded analytics and determine why you might choose it, who is doing it, and how to evaluate available off-the-shelf solutions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>The rise of the data-driven organization</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Organizations are clamoring to unlock the value inside the massive volumes of data they are collecting. Data-driven employees make more informed decisions that help companies beat the competition. Employees need applications that help them make sense of all the data available for decision-making. Then they need to explore and analyze the data so they can make the best decisions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The hunger for data and analytics is changing the expectations that workers have for software. Business users expect customizable dashboards and reports as part of every application they use. More importantly, they expect to be able to quickly and easily explore and interact with data sets. Combine that with the growing complexity, size, and variation in data sets, and software developers are facing increasingly demanding challenges in helping their users and customers gain the insights they need.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Modern data platforms</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We live in a time where the speed and availability of multitudes of data is unprecedented. Every data set can be tapped, combined with others, and analyzed to yield business insights. The challenge of quickly providing powerful insight is compounded by the rapidly developing modern data stores that have been built to handle the dramatic increase in volume, velocity and variety of data -- billions of rows, fast streaming data, and often unstructured textual and document data. There are NoSQL databases like Cassandra, HBase, and MongoDB; data processing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark; query engines like Impala and Hive; stream processing tools like Storm and Kafka; and text indexing frameworks like ElasticSearch and Solr. Cloud providers have entered the fray with scalable and inexpensive datastores such as Amazon’s Redshift, Google’s BigQuery and Spanner, and Microsoft’s HDInsight.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As you can see, building your own visual analytics within your product could quickly strain architectural and developer resources, and their knowledge. You may end up in the not-so-rare scenario where you’re trying to hit a moving target as business users discover new data sources and want them included in their analyses. You may also find your homegrown or legacy analytics solution is locking you into using traditional data stores that don’t meet today’s requirements. Building analytics from scratch <em>might</em> be doable, but how can you budget and plan when requirements are constantly evolving?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Enter embedded analytics</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Embedded analytics is the use of reporting and analytic capabilities (including visualizations) from packaged software running within business applications. The technology opens a rich world of data analysis, visualizations, and business intelligence to developers and their users. The goal is to provide a complete analytics experience from inside an application’s workflow. This puts much needed insights at the user’s fingertips instead of requiring that user to switch to a standalone analytics tool.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are many ways to embed analytics, depending on your requirements (see Figure 1), but the goal is always the same: to help business users explore data efficiently and make the best data-driven decisions for their organizations. Looking at Figure 1, the continuum of embedded analytics options runs from white-label solutions that are quick and easy to integrate up to extended custom developed solutions. Choosing the best method to embed analytics depends on the experience you’re trying to create and the amount of time and resources you have at your disposal.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>White-label rebranding options are very low-effort and very quick time-to-market solutions that run as a separate app, so they don’t provide a seamless user experience. Lightweight integrated options are low-effort and quick time-to-market, while providing a seamless user experience because they are integrated into apps with an iFrame (although some product managers will object to using iFrames for technical reasons). Deeply embedded analytics provide API/SDK-level integration that requires a higher effort and longer time-to-market ,while providing a completely seamless user experience. And finally, the extended option provides custom visualizations and data source integrations for your applications.</p>\n",

      "<p>Done right, embedded analytics will become part of your product and help build your competitive advantage. Your embedded analytics solutions should integrate into your product cycle; be low cost and commercially flexible (in terms of royalties and licensing) so it can provide good ROI; and connect quickly, easily, and in an architecturally sound and extensible way to a variety of modern data sources.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Most importantly, an embedded analytics solution should provide a great user experience. Performance, particularly during interactive data exploration, must be quick or you’ll quash the business analyst’s creativity while he or she sits and waits for charts to be refreshed. Performance can be particularly demanding when combining and analyzing large volumes of data from multiple sources. And remember, when you embed analytics into your application, users and customers see it all as the face of your application, so you need to make sure whatever you embed has a modern look and feel with a well-designed interface and informative visualizations.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>According to <a href=\"https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=376\">JSR 376: Java Platform Module System</a>, the key goals of modularizing the Java SE Platform are:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Reliable configuration</strong>—You must explicitly declare dependencies between modules in a manner that’s recognized <em>both</em> at compile time and execution time. The system can automatically walk through these dependencies (via the module resolver) to determine the subset of all modules required to support your app.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Strong encapsulation</strong>—The packages in a module are accessible to other modules only if the module explicitly “exports” them (that exporting can be restricted to select modules). Even then, another module cannot use those packages unless it explicitly states that it “requires” the other module’s capabilities.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Scalable Java Platform</strong>—Previously, the Java Platform was a <em>monolith</em> consisting of a massive number of packages, making it challenging to develop, maintain, and evolve. It couldn’t easily be subsetted. The platform is now modularized into 95 modules. You can create custom runtimes consisting of <em>only</em> the modules you need for your apps or the devices you’re targeting. For example, if a device does not support GUIs, you could create a runtime that does not include the GUI modules, significantly reducing the runtime’s size.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Greater platform integrity</strong>—Before Java 9, it was possible for application and library developers to use internal APIs in the platform that were not intended for such use. With strong encapsulation, these internal APIs can be truly hidden. This can be problematic when migrating code to Java 9—this issue is being dealt with via deprecation and new comparable public APIs.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Improved performance</strong>—The JVM uses various optimization techniques to improve application performance. <a href=\"https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=376\">JSR 376</a> indicates that these techniques are more effective when it’s known in advance that required types are located only in specific modules.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other benefits of modularity include:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Eliminating \"classpath hell\"</strong>—Prior to modularity, developers used the classpath to specify libraries for use at compilation and execution time. Most developers have experienced classpath problems, some to the extent that the term “classpath hell” was coined to describe them. With modularity, developers switch from using the classpath to using the module path, which eliminates the vast majority of classpath-related problems.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Better system designs</strong>—You may find that modularity helps you come up with cleaner, more logical designs.</p>\n",

As more and more groups and organizations adopt Jupyter, they need to work together with others on notebooks. We have built JupyterLab with the abstractions needed to offer real-time collaboration on all documents (notebooks, text files, etc.). Originally, the primary characteristic of JupyterLab 1.0 was going to be its feature parity with the classic Jupyter Notebook. We realize the transition will take time and that we will need to provide a lot of support and documentation, etc. There are two components of my academic work: teaching and research. On the teaching side I am currently teaching in Cal Poly’s undergraduate Data Science degree program (for Statistics and CS majors). On the research side, Jupyter is my primary area of research. In very broad terms, academia is struggling to understand how code and data, rather than traditional peer-reviewed papers, can be the primary output of academic research.

      "After years of apathetic leadership and poor performance, new owners made big moves, trading perceived franchise player Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut and hiring coach Mark Jackson. The second lesson is that to get the most out of a team requires sensitive management, visionary leadership, and well-run operations. Design teams often suffer in this second area because, compared with other corporate functions like engineering and marketing, design is newer and its appreciation is less sophisticated. This nascency means that (a) most people in an organization have never worked with a truly effective design team, and (b) most designers haven’t been part of fully actualized teams, and so they don’t know what they need in order to realize their own potential. Many design teams have the raw talent to realize the expanded role outlined in the prior chapter, but don’t yet have the maturity to embrace it. A design team’s output is the result not only of their skill, but the sophistication and sensitivity of how they operate. In this chapter, we present a set of qualities of effective design organizations. The qualities are broken up into three groups: Foundation, Output, and Management (Table 1-1). These qualities are indicative of the broader creative/operational split that is required to sustainably deliver good design, and is a theme throughout this book. Output addresses what most people think of when considering design—is the team able to produce quality work across the necessary set of capabilities? To realize team longevity and continued broadening impact, it’s imperative to treat operations as seriously as the work product. The 12 qualities of effective design organizations\n",

      "Foundation\n",
      "Often, in the rush to just get a design team in place and producing work, laying foundational components such as values, principles, and mindset is neglected. Being intentional about the foundation leads to stronger work and more committed team members. Shared Sense of Purpose\n",
      "Meaning and purpose are important for organizations at every level of scale. Every design team is different, so no one charter will apply universally. Focused, Empowered Leadership\n",
      "Successful teams, including design teams, have strong, formal leadership. Leaders have an intimate understanding of how the team should work, make decisions that benefit the team, and have the respect of the team’s members. With small design teams, it is common for a squad of junior-to-senior designers to report to someone who is not a designer, but instead in product management, engineering, or marketing. An example was a Silicon Valley company (that shall remain nameless) that had four design directors as peers, each reporting to the VP of Product Management. And that person was making decisions that affected the design team, even though he didn’t understand the potential that design could be delivering. Focused leadership\n",
      "We’re using the phrase “focused leadership” to mean one or two people are running design and are from within the design organization—these leaders are not also overseeing other functions. While design leaders must be attentive to issues of quality, a common mistake made by many companies is that they place in this role a design visionary, a creative director with big ideas and an obsessive attention to detail. Instead, this design leader’s primary responsibilities will prove organizational, working with other executives to clear the path for design, and serving as a manager, mentor, team builder, and operator for the team itself, creating both a figurative and literal space where design can thrive. In fact, this quality was originally labeled “singular, empowered leadership,” because it’s important that there is a clear line of authority within the design organization (and not a set of supposed leaders, all as peers, reporting into a non-design role). Executive engagement (whether in the form of sponsorship, organizational cover, or simple reporting structures) demonstrates the importance that design has within the organization. Such executive support will prove necessary as the expanded role of design inevitably upsets corporate “business as usual.”3. Authentic User Empathy\n",
      "Essential in design’s ability to succeed is an authentic understanding of user contexts and behaviors. Good user research, particularly out in the field, reveals a richness of understanding that you simply cannot get anywhere else. It is this work that ends up revealing a customer’s journey, and inevitably, the experiential breakdowns that happen when people try to accomplish things that require them to unknowingly cross siloed departments in an organization. A secondary benefit that can be just as important is when executives and other people with authority outside of design witness the results of such user research, whether it’s the raw data (e.g., videos of people expressing frustration with the current situation), or the analyses that makes clear problematic patterns. Understand, Articulate, and Create Value\n",
      "After the dot-com bust in 2001 and the recession that followed, a cry heard throughout the software design community was “How do I demonstrate return on investment (ROI)?” At that time, most companies saw design as a cost of doing business, and something to minimize when times were tight. At Adaptive Path, we pursued this question through research that led to a 2003 report, “Leveraging Business Value: How ROI Changes User Experience.”1 While unable to identify a simple equation of x design leading to y value, the report stated:\n",
      "Our research revealed that using ROI and other valuation methods helps to evolve design competency within organizations. The valuation methods provide tools for developing and measuring a design strategy as a component of a larger business strategy: The ability to “value” user experience design makes it a visible and credible business lever on par with marketing, research and development, and channel strategy. Too often, designers practice design-for-design’s-sake, where what’s produced, however cool or innovative, isn’t connected with the company’s goals. Savvy design leaders embrace business value, realizing it can serve as a powerful input into the design process. And when these business objectives are paired with authentic user empathy, new means of value creation can emerge. When design organizations propose ways to unlock new business value, their credibility and impact increases.Output\n",
      "We are finally at the place where most people begin when thinking about design—making stuff! The following four qualities address the design organization’s capability to produce sufficient, robust, and relevant work. Another implication is that there should be only one design organization to undergird the entire customer journey. This runs contrary to a common practice, where companies often have two teams—a product or UX design team and a marketing design team. “Marketing” and “product” experiences are simply milestones on the same customer journey. Also, whereas traditional marketing design was delivered through media (publications, broadcast, billboards) and product design was for a thing placed on a retail shelf, in a world of connected software, the platform for many marketing and product experiences has converged in digital realms such as email, web, and mobile. Companies beholden to the archaic “marketing” and “product” distinctions also get in the way of new opportunities, such as the rise of “growth” product development, where what would have been considered a classic marketing function (acquiring users) becomes part of product development. Given a single design organization invited to work end to end throughout the customer’s journey, a third implication arises: the need for a vast array of design skills to address the totality of that journey (Table 1-2). Still, the design organization must be accountable and responsible for the delivery of these design practices, whether they are done by people employed full-time, or external contractors and agencies brought in on a project basis. They need to facilitate the creative output of others throughout the organization, tapping into a resource often left dormant. Imagine a conceptual scale that spans a product and services view from 10,000 feet to 1 foot, and place design work along that scale (Figure 1-1). What the percentages show is that while the effort placed in the lower, execution-focused levels will far outweigh that which is spent in the higher levels, in order for design to fulfill its potential, it must deliver across all levels. Instead, bring on two designers as quickly as you can, one who can take the bulk of the lower level work (spending 80% of their time in Surface and 20% in Structure), and another who can do some of that, but also engage strategically and across the organization (spending 60% of their time in Structure, 30% of their time in Strategy, and 10% addressing The Big Picture). When Peter was hired to run design at one company, he inherited an organization whose efforts mostly consisted of turning product managers’ requirements into comps, and where user research made an impact only at the interface level. This drove Peter’s decision to recruit designers who could deliver quality work at the Structure and Strategy levels. As they came onboard, design’s influence grew organically.7. Establish and Uphold Standards of Quality\n",
      "A design organization is ultimately judged by the quality of its output. What’s tricky is that there’s no universal definition of design quality. Sure, design solutions can have quantitative performance measures such as conversion rates and task completion, but they are insufficient in establishing quality. To overcome this, the design organization must be empowered to define quality standards for their team and their organization. Once the design org has established such quality standards, they must hold themselves up to those standards, and not sacrifice. People outside of the design team don’t understand what it takes to maintain a high quality bar, and design teams are asked to do too many things with too few people in too little time. Designers want to make others (clients, colleagues, users) happy. Design leaders need to wield the power of “No.” Design work should only be done when adequately prioritized and staffed, and when there is time to develop quality solutions. What it does mean is empowering the design organization to uphold what it takes to deliver quality, and to decline work that doesn’t fit. Many design organizations rely on process as a proxy for quality. Critical thinking is essential for delivering great work, and an over-adherence to a methodology leads to teams making unthinking decisions. “We must follow a user-centered design process” may sound like a good plan, but when any process becomes an assumption or accepted dogma, it becomes a crutch that replaces critical thinking. Instead of following a well-trod process, design leadership should make the effort to figure out the best ways to tackle different challenges, drawing from a broad methodological toolkit.8. Value Delivery Over Perfection\n",
      "In a world where speed is often vaunted above all else, this talk of upholding quality makes some people nervous. So, “delivery over perfection” is meant to balance “establish and uphold quality.” There’s a quote attributed to Steve Jobs during the development of Macintosh: “Real artists ship.” This recognizes that even the most masterful craftspeople, if they are actually hoping to have some kind of impact, must stop what they’re doing and get their work out into the world. For those who went to design school, every time they made something, they had one chance to get it right. Without sound management practices, a design team turns into a hornet’s nest of disillusionment, putting the quality of the team’s output in jeopardy, and risking retention. Teams Are Made of People, Not Resources\n",
      "The department name “Human Resources” demonstrates how many companies think of their employees—not as people, but as economic units whose role is to contribute to a company’s productivity. Design leadership must make the effort, which can run contrary to the broader organization’s approach, to engage the team members as people. Actualized design teams overcome such practices by treating team members as individuals, with all the messiness implied. They recognize job titles are imperfect, and two people with the same title may have different skills. While maintaining this individualistic perspective is challenging as the design organization grows, it’s worth the effort. Let their freak flags fly.Do team members work reasonable hours? Constant production and overlong hours stagnates work quality, as designers rely on what is basic and safe. Productivity can even go backward—poor decisions designers make while fatigued have to then be undone before the team can move on.Are team members encouraged to grow? Managers must understand how team members want to evolve—do they want to deepen their craft, cross-train into other skills, learn how to lead?—and find ways to support them. Great design managers provide little direction and lots of mentorship—they don’t tell folks what to do, but teach them tools and techniques to help them figure out solutions on their own. When Peter joined one company, he inherited a product design team of 11 men and 2 women, almost all in their mid-20s. Earning one another’s respect is necessary in order for the team to “get real,” because frank and candid critique and feedback are essential for upholding the quality standards. Greatness comes from the tension and collision of different perspectives (a concept known as “creative abrasion”), addressed openly and honestly. Design teams that favor politeness over candor will rarely produce great work. Great design leaders encourage everyone to speak up, and, for themselves, wait to speak last, if at all. These leaders must also place their work alongside others, and accept others’ critique with grace and humility. Great design work takes space—places to collaborate, whiteboards for sketching and ideation, walls to show work. Just because design is “creative,” it shouldn’t get a pass in terms of running effectively. If done well, team members will learn to appreciate the ability to remain focused on the work, instead of being sucked into the work-about-the-work that insidiously steals a surprising amount of time.Our Humanistic Agenda\n",
      "Twentieth-century management practices were dominated by Scientific Management, which sought to squeeze the most productivity out of a workforce, and bureaucracy, which treated employees as interchangeable widgets. This humanistic orientation is even more important for the design team, as the very nature of their work exploits their humanity, from the empathy they draw from customer research to their design solutions expressing their perspectives. Use these 12 qualities as guidelines for assessing a design organization. Have all the team members score the organization against each quality, and use the results to identify areas that need work. 2The levels Strategy, Structure, and Surface are informed by, though slightly altered, from Jesse James Garrett’s The Elements of User Experience (New Riders, 2010).

We recently caught up with Rana to discuss the techniques, possibilities, and challenges around emotion AI today. If we are trying to build technology to communicate with people, that technology should have emotional intelligence (EQ). Technology that reads your emotional state, for example by combining facial and voice expressions, represents the emotion AI space. At Affectiva, we use a variety of computer vision and machine learning approaches, including deep learning. Our technology, like many computer vision approaches, relies on machine learning techniques in which algorithms learn from examples (training data). More recently, we have seen the most traction around conversational interfaces. There are the obvious devices—Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home—but we’ve also seen an increasing need for emotion AI manifesting in automotive, social robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The wealth of data we collected also allowed us to mine our robust data set for cross-cultural and gender differences in expressing emotions. We recently released findings from the largest cross-cultural study on gender differences in facial expressions, which used our technology. Personally, the most compelling use case for me tackles mental health applications: the capabilities here are quite powerful. Outside of that use case, I am particularly interested in applications that monitor mental health for emotional well-being and suicide prevention. We are exploring product concepts that will be able to do just that, so users can better monitor their emotional health and well-being around the clock, and can flag when they are having a bad day.\n",

Orchestration tools like Docker (in Swarm Mode), Kubernetes, and Mesosphere allow you to declare your services once and then run them anywhere using containers.

      "Reliable configuration—You must explicitly declare dependencies between modules in a manner that’s recognized both at compile time and execution time. The system can automatically walk through these dependencies (via the module resolver) to determine the subset of all modules required to support your app. Continue reading Get introduced to the new Java® 9 Platform Module System (JPMS) with Paul Deitel.\n",
